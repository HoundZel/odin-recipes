    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Aglio e olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. The dish is made by lightly saut√©ing sliced, minced, or pressed garlic in olive oil, sometimes with the addition of dried red chili flakes, and tossing with spaghetti. Finely chopped parsley can also be added as a garnish, along with grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese, although according to some traditional recipes, cheese should not be added.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>8 large garlic cloves, minced</li>

        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes.</li>
