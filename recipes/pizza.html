    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>

        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>

    <br>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast over the top, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, olive oil, salt, and the yeast mixture. Mix well and knead to form a smooth dough. Let it rest for about 1 hour, until doubled in size.</li>

        <li>Spread pizza sauce over each round, then layer with mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.</li>
